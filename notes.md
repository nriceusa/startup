## Notes from GitHub Assignment
Though I was already familiar with git, I learned the following about GitHub:
- Forking is similar to cloning, except that it creates a remote copy of the repo on GitHub, rather than in your local machine.
- It is easier to start a GitHub repo from github.com than starting it from your local machine.
- Markdown files can include relative links to files.

## Notes on AWS
- My elastic IP address: 44.215.202.5
- Remember to "release" the elastic IP address when you're done using it so that you don't continue to get charged.
- You are free to stop your server when you're not using it because the elastic IP address will remain the same when you restart it.
- Use this to access your server: `ssh -i ~/.ssh/webserver-production.pem ubuntu@44.215.202.5`
