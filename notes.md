# Notes from GitHub Assignment
Though I was already familiar with git, I learned the following about GitHub:
- Forking is similar to cloning, except that it creates a remote copy of the repo on GitHub, rather than in your local machine.
- It is easier to start a GitHub repo from github.com than starting it from your local machine.
- Markdown files can include relative links to files.
